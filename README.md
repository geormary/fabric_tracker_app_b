- REST API for managing fabric inventory, with endpoints for querying by type, color, and quantity.
- Backend integration with a scalable database for data storage and retrieval.
- Modular design enabling future enhancements, such as usage suggestions and tracking fabric usage trends.
#### Tech Stack
- Web Scraping: Puppeteer (JavaScript/Node.js)
- Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB for scalable and flexible data storage
- API: REST API to handle requests and data delivery
- Deployment: [Optional: Mention tools like Heroku, AWS, or Docker if used]
